Ten, 12 games in, hes really figuring things out and realizes why sit back and let things come to him? Go get it. None of this is surprising to anyone involved. Bedard doesnt show it if he impresses himself. And as grateful as the Blackhawks are to have drafted Bedard, this is what they expected. This is why teams lined up to take losses last season. Its not the NHL that he was playing in the last few years, Davidson said, but the level of performance and how he could control a game and dominate a game in junior it indicated he was going to be able to do that at some point in the NHL.

Even so, there were hopeful signs last week when draft documents coming out of the conference included options to incorporate language that called on countries to phase out fossil fuel use there was also an option not to include such a clause. Then the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC sent a letter to its member states pressuring them to proactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions. Following the letter, language that had previously called on countries to phase out fossil fuels vanished from subsequent draft texts. Backlash was swift. This obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word, former US vice president Al Gore posted on X on Monday. COP28 is now on the verge of complete failure.
